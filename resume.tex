\BulletItem%
OCaml: Standard library, Async, Functional programming techniques
% I have since learned OCaml Core this should be in the sideproject section
% where I have a part about OCaml Ed
% Using options and monads to make life easier
% Statelessness allows for much better concurrency and makes programs easier to
% reason about
\BulletItem%
Type theory, propositional logic, constructive real numbers, convex hull problem
% Value assurance, error handling using option types, monads, functors,
% assurance of invariants through the use of variant checking functions
% Proofs of propositional logic statements using evidence of the existence of a
% function
% Bishop book,
\BulletItem%
Data Structures: Splay trees, Monads, Modules, Functors
% Self balancing BST where most recently used stuff is near to top
% join, bind, return: important for usage of async
% modules as abstraction
% functors as ways to implement generic stuff and conform to protocols
\BulletItem%
Language evaluation: wrote an interpreter for a subset of OCaml
% Small step evaluation: follow order of operations from the leaves of the AST
% Big step evaluation: environment and such stuff; we used this to implement
% OCalf
