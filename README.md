# resume
This is my resume!
It is mostly focused on technical internships and such for companies that do programming.
Here is a [link](files/resume.pdf) to a copy of my resume that I keep around in this repository.
It might not always be the most recent or up to date though.

## Compiling
To compile my resume use XeLaTeX (e.g. latexmk -xelatex), or simply type make.
