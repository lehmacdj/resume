# resume
This is my resume!
It is mostly focused on technical internships and such for companies that do programming.
Here is a [link](files/resume.pdf) to a copy of my resume that I keep around in this repository.
It might not always be the most recent or up to date though.

## Compiling
To compile my resume use XeLaTeX (e.g. latexmk -xelatex), or simply type make.

## Aside
I have a lot of comments in my source file that are there to help me figure out what I meant by what I wrote in my resume.
Feel free to look at them to see further detail on any of the stuff in my resume!
